# RubyMod

---

## What is RubyMod?

RubyMod is a Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft 1.16/1.16.1 (1.16.2 support coming soon!).

Its purpose is for me to learn the Forge Modding API (using mainly the modding tutorial series by TechnoVision on YT).

---

## Features

### Ruby

- The ruby is a new gem with multiple purposes:

- Can be used to craft poisoned apples.

- Can be used to craft red dye.

- Can be used to make ruby tools and armor (pickaxe, sword, axe, shovel, hoe, helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots).

- Obtained from mining or smelting ruby ore.

---

### Ruby Block

- It's a block made out of rubies.

- Comes in a slab and stair versions.

---

### Ruby Ore

- Found in the nether, at the lava lakes' floor.

- Drops a ruby when broken (effected by fortune), or the ore itself with silk touch.

- Can be smelted (or blasted in a blast furnace) to get 1 ruby.

---

### Ruby Tools

- Better than iron but worse than diamond.

---

### Ruby Armor

- Give the same amount of armor points as iron armor, but also give +5 knockback resistance (5 times more than
  netherite!).

- When mining with a ruby pickaxe and full ruby armor, you get haste 1 (Enough to insta-mine stone! No need for a
  beacon!).

---

### Poisoned Apple

- Gives you 7 points of hunger and 14.4 saturation points (as much as a golden carrot).

- Effects you with these effects -

  - Nausea 2 for 7 seconds (100%).

  - Poison 2 for 9 seconds (100%).

  - Glowing 1 for 10 seconds (100%).

  - Hunger 3 for 3 seconds (10%).

  - Blindness 3 for 5 seconds (5%).

  - Luck (!) 1 for 1 second (50%).

- Can always be eaten (even at full hunger).

---

### Ruby Sheep

- A special type of sheep.

- Will follow a player holding wheat or rubies.

- Has 2 more health points than a regular sheep.

- Drops special ruby wool and mutton on death.

- Drops ruby wool when sheared.

- Can be dyed with a ruby.

- Has a spawn egg (Creative Mode only!).

---

### Ruby Wool

- Wool that comes from ruby sheep.

- Drops from ruby sheep.

---

### Ruby Carpet

- A carpet made of ruby wool.

---

### Ruby Water

- Water, but red.

- When you dive in it, it's completely see-through, but from the outside, it's not.

- Will turn to water when it interacts with it.

- Can be picked up in a bucket!

---

### Stinger Enchantment

- When you enchant your sword with this enchantment, it will cause the sword to be poisonous, and every mob you hit will
  be poisoned for 5 seconds.

- Comes in 2 levels.

- Mutually exclusive with Mending and Sharpness.

- Can't be obtained from villagers.

---

### Ruby Barrel

- The ruby barrel is a barrel with 5 rows of storage space.

---

### Ruby Hills

- A new biome with magical red grass.

- Creepers don't spawn in here!

- Mules naturally spawn here. How? Good question.

- The home for the lovely ruby sheep!

---

### Potion of Motivation and Laziness

- The Potion of Motivation can be brewed with a ruby, and it will give you a boost of speed and jump height.

- The Potion of Laziness is an inverted Potion of Motivation, and it will affect you with slowness and nausea.

---

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Centrifuge Block:** Takes "Ruby Items" and returns the purified item (e.g. ruby wool -> wool, poisoned apple ->
  apple).

- **And More To Come!**

---

## Credits

I would like to thank the Forge team for creating the Forge API, TechnoVision for inspiring the mod with your tutorial
series, and Jelly Dash, for helping a lot with your beautiful textures for this mod.
