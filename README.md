# RubyMod
-----------------------
## What is RubyMod?

RubyMod is a Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft 1.16/1.16.1 (1.16.2 support coming soon!);

Its purpose is for me to learn the Forge Modding API (using mainly the modding tutorial series by TechnoVision on YT);

---

## Features       

### Ruby:
- The ruby is a new gem with multiple purposes:

- Can be used to craft poisoned apples;

- Can be used to craft red dye;

- Can be used to make ruby tools and armor (pickaxe, sword, axe, shovel, hoe, helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots);

- Craft 9 rubies together to get a ruby block, which can be later uncrafted back into 9 rubies;
- Obtained from mining or smelting ruby ore;

---

### Ruby Ore:

- Found in the nether, at the lava lakes' floor;

- Drops a ruby when broken (effected by fortune), or the ore itself with silk touch;

- Can be smelted (or blasted in a blast furnace) to get 1 ruby;

---

### Ruby Tools:

- Better than iron but worse than diamond;

---

### Ruby Armor:

- Give the same amount of armor points as iron armor, but also give +5 knockback resistance (5 times more than netherite!);

- When mining with a ruby pickaxe and full ruby armor, you get haste 1 (Enough to instamine stone! No need for a beacon!);

---

### Poisoned Apple:

- Gives you 7 points of hunger and 14.4 saturation points (as much as a golden carrot);

- Effects you with these effects - 

  - Nausea 2 for 7 seconds (100%);

  - Poison 2 for 9 seconds (100%);

  - Glowing 1 for 10 seconds (100%);

  - Hunger 3 for 3 seconds (10%);

  - Blindness 3 for 5 seconds (5%);

  - Luck (!) 1 for 1 second (50%);

- Can always be eaten (even at full hunger);

---

### Ruby Sheep:

- A special type of sheep;

- Will follow a player holding wheat or rubies;

- Has 2 more health points than a regular sheep;

- Drops special ruby wool and mutton on death;

- Drops ruby wool when sheared;

- Cannot be bred and has no baby form (_yet!_);

- Can be dyed with a ruby;

- Has a spawn egg (Creative Mode only!);

---

### Ruby Wool:

- Drops from ruby sheep;

- Can be crafted from any wool;

- Can be used to craft red beds and paintings;

---

### Ruby Carpet:

- Crafted from 8 white carpets and 1 ruby or 2 ruby wool;

---

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Centrifuge Block:** Takes "Ruby Items" and returns the purified item (e.g. ruby wool -> wool, poisoned apple -> apple);

- [ ] **Ruby Biome (Name Not Final):** A custom biome that will spawn ruby sheep (maybe ruby trees?);

- **And More To Come!**
